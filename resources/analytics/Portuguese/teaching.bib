abstract = {The randomly assigned risk of induction generated by the draft lottery is used to construct estimates of the effect of veteran status on civilian earnings. These estimates are not biased by the fact that certain types of men are more likely than others to service in the military. Social Security administrative records indicate that in the early 1980s, long after their service in Vietnam was ended, the earnings of white veterans were approximately 15 percent less than the earnings of comparable nonveterans.},

   abstract = {Many statistical analyses (e.g., in econometrics, biostatistics and experimental design) are based on models containing systems of structurally related equations.  The systemfit package provides the capability to estimate systems of linear equations within the R programming environment.  For instance, this package can be used for \"ordinary least squares\" (OLS),  \"seemingly unrelated regression\" (SUR), and the instrumental variable (IV) methods \"two-stage least squares\" (2SLS) and \"three-stage least squares\" (3SLS), where SUR and 3SLS estimations can optionally be iterated.  Furthermore, the systemfit package provides tools for several statistical tests.  It has been tested on a variety of datasets and its reliability is demonstrated.},
