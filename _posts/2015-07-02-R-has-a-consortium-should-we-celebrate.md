I was surprised by the news about the arising of a new organization for promoting R: the [R Consortium](https://www.r-consortium.org). It's interesting that this new organization says it will do the same thing as the existing R Foundation. 

In fact, I may know already why a new R Consortium. [Jean Tirole](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean_Tirole) is a French professor of economics awarded with a Nobel Memorial Prize in economics and who has studied the [economics of open source](http://www.nber.org/papers/w7600). He believes that commercial companies would have very little incentives to subsidize projects of open source appeal, unless the major beneficiaries of such enterprises could coordinate to put up a consortium, so they can minimize the risk of having too many free-riders.
