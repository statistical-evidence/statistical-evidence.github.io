With a Telegram account connected to `@TeleR`, the force of R can always be with me, where I have data. The following is a screenshot of my mobile:

If you want to have R where you are too, you only need a [Telegram](https://telegram.org/) account; then, you have to search for the public username `@Tele_R`, starting a new chat with. Thanks to [TeleMath Team](http://telemath.altervista.org/TeleR.html), you will be able to send R commands as messages and get answers back.
