Yesterday, more Scots than ever since universal suffrage was introduced cast a ballot on the matter of independence. 

The turnout was itself phenomenal and that potentially implicates  a series of questions for the government authorities and citizens. For the time being the sole question is: would this benefit one side or the other? The verdict favored the *NO*--better together--with a margin little higher than indicated by polls of major polling houses fielded over the last week. This also returns to the point I raised roughly a month ago: evidence from the political science literature suggests voters who fail to promptly decide are more likely to vote for the status quo in referendums like this.
