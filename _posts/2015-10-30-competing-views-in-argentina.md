The last poll published today by *Polldata* put Scioli below 40%, with about 5% reporting being undecided.
It might be too early to state anything solid, but the few polls prospecting the runoff election in Argentina seem to be telling two distinct histories. Polling houses *Hugo Haime* and *IPSOS* suggest that Daniel Scioli is going up while *Elypsis*  and *Polldata* say he's actually sinking as the weeks go by. The last poll published today by *Polldata* puts Scioli below 40%, with about 5% reporting being undecided. My experience following  multiparty elections suggests that polls perform much better in the runoff than in primaries, meaning that the average of the polls now is much more close to the real vote preference than reported before.
