## TODO list

Here's a list of blog post ideas I've jotted down at some point in the past. The vast majority of these I'll never get around to though I expect some of these (most?) have already been done somewhere. In fact if it hasn't been done by someone it's probably not a good idea or the data doesn't exist. That said, feel free to develop and implement any of theseâ€”I'd be interested to hear about the outcomes!
